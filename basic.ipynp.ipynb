What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n","\n","  -> Python is a programming language that is widely used in web applications, software development, data science, and machine learning . python is popular because easy to learn and can run on many different platforms.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n","\n","  -> In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, without requiring it to be compiled into machine code first. It translates the code into machine-readable instructions and then executes them directly.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n","\n","  -> Python keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings and purposes in the language. These keywords are an integral part of Python's syntax and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). They are always available and do not need to be imported.\n","\n","\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n","\n","  ->  No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in most programming languages. Keywords are reserved words with specific meanings within the language, and using them as variable names would lead to conflicts and ambiguity.\n","\n","\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python ?\n","\n","  ->  In Python, mutability refers to an object's ability to be        changed after it is created. Mutable objects can be modified in place, meaning their internal state or data can be altered without creating a new object.\n","\n","  \n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n","\n","  -> Tuples and lists are the same in every way except two: tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets, and the items in tuples cannot be modified (but the items in lists can be modified). We often call lists mutable (meaning they can be changed) and tuples immutable (meaning they cannot be changed).\n","\n","\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n","\n","  ->  He == and is operators in Python are both used for comparison, but they check for different things:\n","  \n","  == Operator\n","Checks for equality: The == operator compares the values of two objects. It returns True if the values are equal and False otherwise.\n","Value-based comparison: It checks if the content or data held by the objects is the same.\n","Customizable: The behavior of == can be customized by implementing the __eq__ method in a class.\n","\n","is Operator\n","Checks for identity: The is operator compares the memory locations of two objects. It returns True if both variables refer to the same object in memory, and False otherwise.\n","Reference-based comparison: It verifies if two references point to the exact same object in memory.\n","Not customizable: The behavior of is cannot be modified.\n","\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n","\n","  -> Logical operators in Python are used to combine or modify conditional statements. They operate on boolean values (True or False) and return a boolean result. There are three main logical operators in Python.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python ?\n","\n","  ->  Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of changing a variable's data type to another. This is done to ensure compatibility between different data types or to perform specific operations.\n","\n","  There are two main types of type casting in Python:\n","\n","1. Implicit Type Conversion:\n","Python automatically converts one data type to another in certain situations without the user's explicit intervention. This usually happens when performing operations involving different data types.\n","\n","2.  Explicit Type Conversion:\n","Explicit type conversion, also known as type casting, occurs when you deliberately convert a value from one data type to another using built-in functions. This is necessary when Python's implicit conversion does not meet your requirements.\n","\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","\n","  -> Implicit type casting, also known as widening or upcasting, is automatically performed by the compiler when a smaller data type is converted to a larger one. Explicit type casting, also known as narrowing or downcasting, requires the programmer to explicitly convert a larger data type to a smaller one, often involving the risk of data loss.\n","\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n","\n","   -> Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of a program based on whether certain conditions are true or false. They allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on the outcome of these conditions.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work ?\n","\n","  -> Elif' stands for 'else if' and is used in Python programming to test multiple conditions. It is written following an if statement in Python to check an alternative condition if the first condition is false. The code block under the elif statement will be executed only if its condition is true.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n","\n","  -> The primary difference between for and while loops lies in their purpose and the nature of their execution. for loops are typically used when you know how many times you want to iterate or when you need to process each element of a sequence, while while loops are used when you want to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met, which may not be a predetermined number of times.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n","\n","  -> In programming, for loops are best used when you know the number of iterations ahead of time, whereas a while loop is best used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance. Both methods can help you iterate through your code.\n","\n","\n","    "],"metadata":{"id":"IQVttqwuoTHD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"8YGRC01NoPc6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\n","\n","'''\n","print(\"hello world\")\n","\n","'''\n","#  Write a Python program that displays your name and age\n","\n","'''\n","name = input(\"please Enter your name\")\n","Age =  int(input(\"please Enter your age\"))\n","print(f\"name:{name}\")\n","print(f\"Age:{Age}\")\n","\n","'''\n","#  Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library.\n","\n","'''\n","import keyword\n","\n","# printing the keywords\n","print(\"Python keywords are...\")\n","print(keyword.kwlist)\n","\n","'''\n","\n","# Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword.\n","\n","\n","'''\n","import keyword\n","\n","def is_keyword(word):\n","    \"\"\"Checks if a given word is a Python keyword.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        word: The word to check.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        True if the word is a keyword, False otherwise.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    return keyword.iskeyword(word)\n","\n","# Example usage\n","word1 = \"for\"\n","word2 = \"hello\"\n","\n","print(f\"'{word1}' is a keyword: {is_keyword(word1)}\")\n","print(f\"'{word2}' is a keyword: {is_keyword(word2)}\")\n","\n","\n","'''\n","\n","# Create a list and tuple in Python, and demonstrate how attempting to change an element works differently for each.\n","\n","'''\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","my_tuple = (4, 5, 6)\n","\n","print(\"Original list:\", my_list)\n","print(\"Original tuple:\", my_tuple)\n","\n","my_list[1] = 10\n","print(\"Modified list:\", my_list) # Output: [1, 10, 3]\n","\n","\n","my_list[1] = 10\n","print(\"Modified list:\", my_list) # Output: [1, 10, 3]\n","\n","'''\n","\n","\n","#  Write a function to demonstrate the behavior of mutable and immutable arguments.\n","\n","'''\n","def modify_args(immutable_arg, mutable_arg):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Demonstrates the behavior of mutable and immutable arguments in Python.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        immutable_arg: An immutable object (e.g., int, string, tuple).\n","        mutable_arg: A mutable object (e.g., list, dictionary).\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    # Attempt to modify the immutable argument\n","    immutable_arg = immutable_arg + 1  # This creates a new object\n","    print(f\"Inside the function - Immutable Arg: {immutable_arg}\")\n","\n","    # Modify the mutable argument\n","    mutable_arg.append(4)  # This modifies the original object\n","    print(f\"Inside the function - Mutable Arg: {mutable_arg}\")\n","\n","# Example usage\n","immutable_var = 5\n","mutable_var = [1, 2, 3]\n","\n","print(f\"Before function call - Immutable Var: {immutable_var}\")\n","print(f\"Before function call - Mutable Var: {mutable_var}\")\n","\n","modify_args(immutable_var, mutable_var)\n","\n","print(f\"After function call - Immutable Var: {immutable_var}\")\n","print(f\"After function call - Mutable Var: {mutable_var}\")\n","\n","'''\n","\n","#  Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two user-input numbers\n","\n","'''\n","def arithmetic_operations():\n","    try:\n","        num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n","        num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n","    except ValueError:\n","        print(\"Invalid input.
